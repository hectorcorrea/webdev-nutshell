# Web development in a nutshell workshop
This repository contains the materials for the Web Development in a Nutshell workshop to be presented at [Wintersession 2024](https://winter.princeton.edu/).

Keep in mind that *at this point all the materials are in a very early draft state*

File [tutorial.md](https://github.com/hectorcorrea/webdev-nutshell/blob/main/tutorial.md) has most of the material that we will cover during the workshop.

The slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dFwsNCUd7iTUzFKF7Po1DZ5KLFQ0t7qprB5VrCiABaM/edit#slide=id.g25432a504aa_0_0)

There are two options to download the code examples:

1. If you have Git installed on your machine you can clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hectorcorrea/webdev-nutshell.git
cd webdev-nutshell
```

2. If you don't have Git installed you can download this repository as a zip file and unzip it:

```
Download https://github.com/hectorcorrea/webdev-nutshell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd webdev-nutshell-main
```


## Required software
For this workshop you'll need to have a text editor and Ruby installed on your machine. The easiest way to get this done is by installing:

* Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

Visual Studio Code is a text editor that works on Mac, Windows, and Linux. It also provides connectivity to Docker which we will use to download a container with Ruby installed on it.

If you already have a version of Ruby running on your machine then you don't need Docker. Any version 2.x or 3.x of Ruby would be OK for this workshop.

If you don't have Ruby already installed on your machine and you don't want to install Docker then you will need to follow the instructions in https://www.ruby-lang.org to download Ruby and install it. Beware that the installation process for Ruby is different on each operating system.
