# Web Development in a Nutshell

## Required software
For this workshop you'll need to install

* Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Docker (https://www.docker.com/)

We'll use Docker to download a container with Ruby installed on it. If you have Ruby already installed on your machine (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) you technically don't need Docker.

You can check if Ruby is already installed on your machine by running a command like this:

```
ruby --version

  # Should display something like
  # ruby 3.1.0p0 (2021-12-25 revision fb4df44d16) [x86_64-darwin22]
```

## Getting started
First install the required software indicated in the previous section.

Then, if you have a GitHub account go to https://github.com/hectorcorrea/webdev-nutshell/ and clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/hectorcorrea/webdev-nutshell.git

  # Should display something like
  # Cloning into 'webdev-nutshell'...
  # remote: Enumerating objects: 41, done.
  # ...
  # Unpacking objects: 100% (41/41), done.
```

If you don't have a GitHub account download this file https://github.com/hectorcorrea/webdev-nutshell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip and unzip it on your machine.
